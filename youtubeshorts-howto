Since i got some problems with youtube_dl i install directrly from yt-dlp mastermy version of 
linux (windows 11 with ubuntu) give me this error:  Error: Error: Unable to extract uploader id
at this time, i did need to make a dirty trick to make it work, here is what i did:

$ echo $(date)
Wed Aug 14 08:15:40 CST 2024
$ uname -a
Linux DESKTOP-0F5KRLC 5.15.153.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Fri Mar 29 23:14:13 UTC 2024 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
$ cat /etc/issue
Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS \n \l
$ python3 --version
Python 3.8.10
$ pip3 --version
pip 20.0.2 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.8)

Into new changes are push to this version of ubuntu in wsl image in windows 11, i
install the most recent version of yt-dlp directly from master repository, and
use os.system() function and call yt-dlp directly (temp solution):

python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/archive/master.tar.gz
or sudo if you want all over Operating system

Either at this time non off youtube_dl or pafy work.
